      "Eighteenth-century Hawaiian historian Samuel Manaiakalani Kamakau traces Hawaiʻi's history from ʻUmi, high chief eight generations before Kamehameha I, to the death of Kamehameha III in 1854. This volume covers the arrival of Captain James Cook, the consolidation of the Hawaiian kingdom by Kamehameha I, the coming of the missionaries, and the changes affecting the kingdom through the reign of Kamehameha III.This history was originally written by Kamakau in Hawaiian as a series of newspaper articles in the 1860s and 1870s. The English translation was completed by a team of esteemed Hawaiian scholars including Mary Kawena Pukui, Thomas G. Thrum, Lahilahi Webb, Emma Davidson Taylor, and John Wise, and first published in 1961.",

      "The number of place names in the Hawaiian Islands defies estimation, encompassing a vast array of features ranging from taro patches to the tiniest spots of miraculous significance. These names are in a constant state of flux, with new ones being bestowed upon houses, streets, and towns while old ones fade into obscurity. Recognizing the urgency of preserving this cultural heritage, efforts are made to document the names and associated lore while native Hawaiian knowledge is still accessible. Despite the challenges faced by the Hawaiian language, the enduring nature of place names ensures their continued presence in the islands' identity. The latest edition of, Place Names of Hawaiʻi, expands its coverage to approximately 4,000 entries, including names in both English and Hawaiian, surpassing previous atlases and affirming the significance of this ongoing endeavor.",
